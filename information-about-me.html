		And during that time I'm planning to improve my skills in <span class="important-text">(javascript, Dart, Flutter)</span> this procces is going to take 2-5 years of experience.

		<h1>HOW I STARTED</h1>
		<p>
		When I was about 16 years old I was obssessed with a game called League of Legends which made me wonder how did they design these awesome charachter in the game, After that I decided to learn photoshop myself so I can have the ability to create such awesome charachters and have more knowledge about how can someone create a game in the first place, <span class="important-text">it took me about 6 months to learn Adobe Photoshop from scratch and another 6 months to learn Adobe Illustrator.</span></br>
		it was a fun journey for me but I felt like I really needed to expand my knowledge in the field of digital technologies and digital media, so I decided I'm going to study New Media since it included most of the topics that I wanted to learn about. While studying I decided to learn more about video editing and montaging, and now I have really wide knowledge in the field.
